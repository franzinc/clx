This file describes the differences between X11 R5 CLX and the version of
CLX in this directory.

This CLX is different in two main areas:
	1) It works only with ACL versions 3.1.10 and greater.  (If you need
	   a version of CLX that works with ACL versions < 3.1.10, please get
	   the R5 CLX distribution from MIT).
	2) It has some fixes that are too recent to be in R5 CLX.

===============================================================================

General changes, applicable to all ports:
----------------------------------------
Version string updated to "MIT R5.0 (Franz ACL4.1)".

10.3 and 10.4 for details

if the case is non sensitive.

Instances of excl:defcmacro changed to define-compiler-macro in exclcmac.cl.
Compatibility code put in excldep.cl and package.cl.  Moved type checking
