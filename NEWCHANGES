This file describes the differences between X11 R5 CLX and the version of
CLX in this directory.

This CLX is different in two main areas:
	1) It works only with ACL versions 3.1.10 and greater.  (If you need
	   a version of CLX that works with ACL versions < 3.1.10, please get
	   the R5 CLX distribution from MIT).
	2) It has some fixes that are too recent to be in R5 CLX.

===============================================================================

General changes, applicable to all ports:
----------------------------------------
Support for 2 bit deep images.  This is somewhat controversial as 2
bit deep images are an extension to the X protocol (used by Pencom
in their Next X11 server).
	-- lots

Added parse-geometry and parse-color functions.  See C Xlib manual, sections
10.3 and 10.4 for details
	-- parse-geometry				manager.l
	-- parse-color					manager.l
	-- export list					package.l

Added wm-client-window function, analagous to C's XmuClientWindow function.
	-- wm-client-window, try-children		manager.l
	-- export list					package.l

Added perror() messages to socket code.
	--						socket.c

Fixed bug in trace-error-print -- must provide :asynchronous keyword
to make-condition
	-- trace-error-print				trace.cl

Version string updated to "MIT R5.0 (Franz ACL4.1)".
	-- *version*					clx.l

===============================================================================
Franz specific changes, applicable to Allegro and Extended Common Lisps:
(note that all these changes are #+excl or #+allegro, so if you're not
 using our product these changes are "commented" out)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
set-case-mode removed from Makefile.  Instead issue warning in package.cl
if the case is non sensitive.
	-- 						Makefile
	-- top level form				package.l

Change default rule to be partial-clos, instead of no-clos.  Also add hook
for ACL $(XCFLAGS) variable.
	--						Makefile

README file made correct for this version.
	--						README

Provided :clx when loading clx interpreted.  Removed patch code from excldep.cl.
	-- top level form				excldep.cl
	-- lots						excldep.cl
 
Instances of excl:defcmacro changed to define-compiler-macro in exclcmac.cl.
Compatibility code put in excldep.cl and package.cl.  Moved type checking
stuff to exclcmac, so it's loaded after types are defined.  Exclcmac is
also now loaded into CLX.fasl.
	-- lots						exclcmac.cl
	-- define-compiler-macro			excldep.cl
	-- import list in defpackage			package.cl
	-- cat list					Makefile

New defsystem for ACL 4.1
	--						defsystem.cl
