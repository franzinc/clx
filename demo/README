This directory contains some code for testing and showing off CLX.

MENU.LISP:

  This file demonstrates a simple menu implementation described in
  Kimbrough, Kerry, "Windows to the Future", Lisp Pointers, Oct-Nov, 1987.
  Try calling 

  (xlib::just-say-lisp "")
  (xlib::pop-up "" '("chocolate" "strawberry" "asparagus"))

HELLO.LISP:

  Pops up a window displaying a string. Click on it to make it
  go away. Try calling 

  (xlib::hello-world "" :string "This space for rent.")


BEZIER.LISP,
ZOID.LISP:

  Defines some extensions for drawing bezier splines and trapezoids,
  respectively.

  Bezier is a demo of how to use protocol extensions.  Since this demo
  defines CLX stubs for the X_PolyBezier X request defined in the
  "bezier" extension, you have to have the macros and bufmac files
  loaded, which define macros needed to compile CLX stubs.  The macros
  and bufmac files aren't normally loaded by load-clx, as they are only
  needed to compile CLX stubs for protocol requests, and aren't need to
  just use CLX.  You can load them by specifying :macros-p t to
  load-clx.

  Lucid users: Remember that CLX stubs for protocol requests in lucid
  lisp have to be compiled with the production compiler, so this file
  has to be compiled with the production compiler.

BEZIERTEST.LISP:
  Compile and load bezier.lisp, and try:

  (xlib::bezier-test "" "/usr/X.V11R1/extensions/test/datafile")

  The second argument is a file containing a picture described as 
  a set of splines. Unfortunately, this is not currently part of the
  CLX release.
